# Scalability
- Veritical: increase the instance size - limit in term of hardware
- Horizontal: increase the number of instances - distributed system (common/modern application)
    - Auto scaling
    - Load balancer

# High availibilty
- System running at least 2 data centers (or AZ)
- HA system could be active-passive or active-active

# ELB (Elastic Load balancer)
- Forward the traffic to multiple servers downstream.
- Some features: eg stickiness/high available/SSL termination/health check
- Integrated with a lots of AWS services (EC2/ASG/WAF/etc)
- Types: 
    - Classic - deprecated : HTTP/HTTPS/TCP/SSL
    - ALB (v2): HTTP/HTTPS/Websocket
    - NLB: TCP/TLS/UDP
    - Gateway: Layer3 operation

## Application Load balancer
- Layer 7 (Web: HTTP/HTTPS)
- Multiple applications/target group
- HTTP/2 and Websocket
- Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS
- Routing rules based on:
    - path
    - hostname
    - Query string and headers

### Target group types:
- EC2 instance
- ECS Tasks
- Lambda functions
- IP address
